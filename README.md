# spotify-player

This is a basic project to create a React Spotify player using this tutorial: https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-build-a-spotify-player-with-react-in-15-minutes-7e01991bc4b6

The scaffolded code that started this project is linked here: https://github.com/JoeKarlsson/react-spotify-player but I wanted to use Vite to create my react app instead of CRA.
